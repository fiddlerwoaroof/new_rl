======

Currently this is more a roguelike engine than a roguelike.  Monster
interaction is limited to attacking stationary monsters, item interaction to
picking up items and terrain generation is rudimentary. Additionally, it has
no name.  Hopefully all this will change.

TODO
----

- Find a name
- Find a plot
- Fix bugs, etc.

RUNNING
-------

- install prerequisites: `pip install twisted pyyaml`
- run `makelinks.sh` if on a mac, pass the argument `darwin`. (Windows user will need to get a copy of libtcod themselves)
- run main.py with python2.7 `python main.py`
